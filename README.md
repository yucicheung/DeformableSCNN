# Deformable SCNN

This repo combines the work in [Spiking Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Energy-Efficient Object Recognition](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-014-0788-3) and [Deformable Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06211), trying to prove the feasibility of deform-conv applying to SCNN.
